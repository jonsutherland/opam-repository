# Install poetry (https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
RUN pip3 install --user poetry==1.0.10

# Poetry will create the virtual environment in $(pwd)/.venv.
# The containers running this image can load the virtualenv with
# $(pwd)/.venv/bin/activate and do not require to run `poetry install`
# It speeds up the Tezos CI and simplifies the .gitlab-ci.yml file
# by avoiding duplicated poetry setup checks.
